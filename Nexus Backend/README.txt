Open the Terminal in the Nexus Backend Folder
(i prefer using git bash, opens the venv immediately)

1. cd "Nexus Backend" 
Ensures your Terminal is in the correct spot

2. pip intsall -r requirments.txt
All the needed files

3. python app.py
opens the backend and can be opened at 
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

4. Run the frontend with "live server", the extension is on vscode and open it at catalog
(so far the part which i have working with the db)
