if using git bash 


1. cd "Nexus Backend" 
Ensures your Terminal is in the correct spot

2. pip install -r requirements.txt
All the needed files

3. python app.py

4. Run the frontend with "live server", the extension is on vscode and open it at catalog
(so far the part which i have working with the db)
